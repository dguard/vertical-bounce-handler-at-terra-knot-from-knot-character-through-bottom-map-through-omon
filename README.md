#### Update Strategy (knot read that)

we begin from bottom-statement <-

echo-locator (4)

pencil-from-knot (3)

-> bind (2)

pencil (1)

echo-locator traversaring updates from one knot to another knot

pencil-from-knot used for interaction with user inside knot

pointer into latest success update. "it" uses bind strategy to stack bind-updates. bind-updates are created from pencil and packaged from updates-stack into bind-updates. Pointer moved after packaging into knot.

use pencil to protect visual memory and put updates into updates-stack. <-

and we have pointer at head and pencil at knot <-

pencil updates itself from updates-stack (1) and from pencil from bind-updates (2) and "it" packaged into bind-updates. pointer into bind-updates. <-
